## 1 Background 
Let's say you are building your own web application. Assuming you already built the front end (which will be covered in another post), let's focus on the back end of the app. We will go through all the necessary components in an organized manner. 

## 2 Backend's roadmap 

### 2.1 Internet: 
First, you need to know how the Internet works, in which I have coverred in this post: <br/>
[What happens when you type a URL into your browser? â€” The big picture (with Cloud)](https://medium.com/@locvicvn1234/what-happens-when-you-type-a-url-into-your-browser-the-with-aws-ec2-8d53dca6decc)

Mainly from this post, after you have the front-end, you will need: 
- A version control system (Git) and repo hosting service (eg, Github) to store your code and colab with others
- A database to store your data.
- API to allow applications to talk to each other
- A cache to help your user access the data faster
- Testing 
- Security to secure your app


### 2.2 Version Control and Repo hosting service 

I believe every engineer needs to know about version control such as Git and repo hosting service like Github. Some companies might use different repo hosting service. 

### 2.3 Database 

Deciding which types of database you need for your app is very important. 

#### 2.3.1 Relational database 

A relational database is a type of database that organizes and stores data in a tabular form, using tables, rows, and columns.

Most relational databases work with SQL.
